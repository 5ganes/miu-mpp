Answer :
      listsAreEqual() method in EmployeeInfo class is calling a method List.contains(employeeObj) which calls
      a method equals from Object super class which is not overridden in Employee class.
      To override equals method in sub class, an object of Object class should be sent as parameter not
      Employee object as parameter.
      If we do not override equals method in Employee class, equals method only looks for the reference of both
      objects in heap memory and finds different references of objects which gives false.
      If we override equals method of Object class in Employee correctly as in my implementation, it works.
